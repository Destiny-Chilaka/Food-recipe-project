                    <p >There’s nothing wrong with a classic, simple peanut butter (or sunflower
                        seed butter) and jelly or turkey sandwich, but if you’re looking for other options or simple
                        ways to change those up, these ideas will help.</p>
                        

                      <p>  All of these can be served to little and big kids—younger kids may need some adjustments
                        made—and each is a simple lunch idea for kids.</p>
                        

                    <p>  <strong>  How to Make a Sandwich for Kids:</strong>
                        
                          A regular sandwich can be a complicated mix of textures for toddlers, so have patience while
                          they learn to eat and chew and consider ways to make it easier for them to eat their lunch. Here
                          are some tips to consider.</p>
                          

                       <p> Think deconstructing the elements, dicing the sandwich up small, making sure the bread is thin,
                        soft, and easy to chew, and offering a drink so they have enough moisture in their mouth.
                        You can use whole grain bread (like Dave’s Killer Bread, Food for Life, bakery fresh whole grain
                        bread, or homemade bread), whole grain rolls, pita bread, flatbread, lavash, or tortillas.</p>
                        

                       <p> I try to use whole grains when possible, though your kids may prefer white flour and find those
                        products easier to chew (as they tend to be softer). Try a few different options to see what
                        works best for your kids and feel free to mix it up each week to offer a range of nutrients and
                        textures.</p>
                        
                       <p> Add fresh fruit, an applesauce pouch, canned fruit cup (in 100% juice), easy veggies for lunch,
                        milk, and/or water to any lunch to round it out.
                        TIP: Adjust portions as indicated by the hunger of your own unique child. There’s no one right
                        portion size!</p>
