                        Baked or fried?
                        Usually, when we talk about doughnuts we are referring to the fried version, but not everyone
                        can handle their heavy nature. For those looking for a close, lighter substitute, there are
                        indeed baked versions that taste just as good.

                        The fried
                        Let’s start as basic as it gets, a fried doughnut dusted in sugar. Nothing fancy, just simple
                        goodness.
                    </p>


                    <p> <strong>Ingredients:</strong>


                        100 milliliters warm water,
                        150 milliliters warm milk,
                        2 teaspoons dry yeast,
                        50 grams sugar,
                        2 eggs,
                        100 grams butter,
                        500 grams flour,
                        pinch of salt,
                        oil, for frying,
                        sugar, to coat.
                    </p>

                    <p> <strong> Instructions:</strong>

                        Mix the warm water with the yeast and a bit of the sugar, continue mixing until the yeast has
                        dissolved. Let it rest for a bit so that the yeast can activate (it will get bubbly, or at least
                        some bubbles should form). Add the remaining sugar, milk, salt and eggs into it the mix. Melt
                        the
                        butter and add it into the dough then start mixing it while gradually adding the flour. Continue
                        working the dough until you get it smooth, cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel and let it
                        rest
                        for about an hour in a warm place.</p>


                    <p> Once the dough has risen, roll it out on some flour until it is fairly thin (0.25 centimeters,
                        or
                        0.25 inches thick) and cut out the doughnut shape with either a doughnut cutter or simply use a
                        large-ish glass and a small cookie cutter for the characteristic shape. Going at it with a knife
                        to
                        freehand the shapes is another way to go about it, but it will take a bit longer. Set the
                        cut-out
                        donuts aside and continue rolling out and cutting out until the whole dough has been used up.
                    </p>


                    <p> Heat up some oil in a deep pan and carefully lower the doughnuts one by one. You can test if the
                        oil
                        is hot enough by throwing in a scrap of dough. You’ll see how it’ll react. Fry the doughnut on
                        both
                        sides until it is golden brown and let the excess oil drip off on paper towels.

                        While the doughnuts are still fairly hot you can toss them in sugar to coat them.</p>
