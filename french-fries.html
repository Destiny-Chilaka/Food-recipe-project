                    <p >The fries boiled in plain water disintegrated, making them nearly impossible
                        to pick up. When I added them to the hot oil, they broke apart even further. On the other hand,
                        those boiled in the vinegared water remained perfectly intact, even after boiling for a full ten
                        minutes.</p>
                        
                       <p> When fried, they had fabulously crisp crusts with tiny, bubbly, blistered surfaces that
                        stayed crisp even when they were completely cool. As for the flavor, if I tasted really hard, I
                        could pick up a faint vinegary undertone, though I wouldn't have if I didn't know it was there.
                        Even knowing it was there, it wasn't unpleasant at all. After all, I'm used to putting my fries
                        in ketchup or mayo, both of which contain plenty of acid.</p>
                        

                       <p> This is a picture of one of the fries which I bent a full ten minutes after it had come out of
                        the oil. See how crisp is stays?

                        A fully cooked McDonald's french fry broken toward the end to show it being crispy.
                        Freezing Fries for a Fluffy Interior
                        Now that I'd perfected the crust, the final issue to deal with was that of the interior.</p>
                        
                       <p> One last question remained: how to maximize the flavor of the interior. In order to stay fluffy and
                        not gummy, a lot of the interior moisture needs to be expelled in the cooking process, so my
                        goal should be to make this evaporation as easy as possible. I figure that so far, by cooking it
                        all the way to boiling point, I'm doing pretty much the right thing—the more cooked the potatoes
                        are, the more the cell structure breaks down, and the easier it is for water to be expelled.</p>
                        
                        <p>To confirm this, I cooked three batches of potatoes, starting each in a pot of cold, vinegared
                            water, and bringing them up to various final temperature (170°F, 185°F, and 212°F) before
                            draining and double-frying them.</p>
