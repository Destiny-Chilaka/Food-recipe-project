                    <p>I made this grilled chicken shawarma with the intention of making these
                        sandwich wraps, but then I started topping salads with it and eventually just snacked on the
                        chicken plain. It’s just that good. You could really use this flavorful chicken for anything.
                    </p>
                    

                    <p> I divided the ingredient list to show just the chicken & marinade in case you want to use it for
                        something other than the sandwich, because even if you don’t want the sandwich, you NEED to at
                        least try the chicken.</p>
                    

                    <p> <strong> INGREDIENTS</strong>
                        
                       <strong> CHICKEN & MARINADE:</strong>
                        2 large chicken breasts (1.25 lbs) ($2.48)
                        1/2 cup plain yogurt ($0.25)
                        1 Tbsp garlic, minced ($0.36)
                        1 Tbsp lemon juice ($0.32)
                        1/2 tsp cinnamon ($0.03)
                        1/2 tsp dried oregano ($0.03)
                        1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)
                        1/4 tsp ground nutmeg ($0.03)
                        1/4 tsp ground cloves ($0.03)</p>
                    

                    <p> <strong> YOGURT SAUCE</strong>
                        

                        7 oz cup plain greek yogurt ($1.59)
                        1/4 tsp garlic, minced ($0.03)
                        1/4 tsp dried dill ($0.03)
                        1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
                    </p>
                    

                    <p> <strong> SANDWICH</strong>
                        

                        4 homemade naan, pita or flatbread ($0.64)
                        1/2 head romaine lettuce ($0.80)
                        1 medium cucumber ($0.69)
                        2 medium roma tomatoes ($0.63)
                    </p>
                    

                    <p> <strong> INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
                        

                        In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade (yogurt, lemon juice, garlic,
                        cinnamon, oregano, salt, nutmeg, and clove). Add chicken to the marinade, coat well, cover and
                        refrigerate for 4-24 hours. If desired, slice the chicken into strips before marinating to
                        maximize the flavor.
                    </p>
                    

                    <p> Prepare the yogurt sauce for the sandwiches. Open a 7 oz. container of plain greek yogurt and
                        stir in the garlic, dill, and salt. Refrigerate until ready to use.
                        After marinating the chicken, grill until cooked through (I use a George Foreman, cooked for
                        about 7 minutes).</p>
                    

                    <p> Prepare the vegetables for the sandwich. Chop, rinse, and drain the lettuce in a colander. Wash
                        and slice the cucumber and tomato.
                        Build the chicken shawarma sandwiches. Spread the yogurt sauce on your flat bread, top with the
                        chicken and vegetables. Roll the sandwich closed. You can wrap the sandwich in foil to help it
                        stay closed as you eat.</p>
