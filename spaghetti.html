                    <p>Speedy spicy spaghetti arrabbiata is a quick pasta dinner harnessing the
                        flavor of
                        dried herbs,
                        fresh garlic, and a sweet kick of balsamic vinegar.
                        This simple arrabbiata sauce recipe is also versatile. With a few modifications,
                        you can make multiple pasta dishes using the same quick method.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p> While I have several quick and easy spaghetti recipes like my pasta pomodoro or spaghetti
                        carbonara that are
                        ready in minutes, this spaghetti and meat sauce recipe is the ultimate Sunday, long-simmer
                        dinner.

                        This is the type of pasta dinner recipe you can easily have at the ready thanks to a simply
                        stocked pantry
                        and a few foundation refrigerator ingredients I can always find at my local Smith’s Marketplace
                        / Kroger
                        store.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> My Mom’s spaghetti recipe is both Italian in its inspiration and American in its popularity. It
                        doesn’t call
                        for anything extraordinary. In fact, it’s totally basic, and that’s what makes it all the
                        better.

                        Here’s what’s in this spaghetti and meat sauce:

                        Ground Beef. I use 85% lean ground angus beef for my sauce so it still has flavor but not a lot
                        of fat. My
                        sister has taken to using ground turkey, also a great option.
                        Tomato sauce. Plain is best to create a tomato bath for the other ingredients to infuse.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Diced tomatoes. You could use canned whole tomatoes and then crush with your hands and fingers.
                        But mom’s
                        recipe says diced so that’s what I do.
                        Tomato paste. This gives the sauce body and also a little sweetness.
                        Beef broth. Another layer of meatiness. My sister amended her recipe to use condensed, but I
                        used regular
                        here.</p>

                    <p>Canned mushrooms. Typically I will always use fresh mushrooms in recipes, but this is one time I
                        never,
                        ever, ever do. There’s just something about the canned version that becomes my favorite part of
                        the sauce,
                        and the reason I typically double the amount the recipe calls for.
                        A splash of wine.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Mom says to use the empty mushroom can as your measurement guide. The key to cooking with
                        wine is to purchase one that is of the same quality you’d be willing to drink. I’d say look for
                        a bottle
                        that costs around $10 or so (I tend to use a blended red or Pinot noir in this spaghetti
                        recipe).
                        Onion, celery and fresh garlic. They’re always lollying around the refrigerator crisper waiting
                        to be used.
                        Dried herbs, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of sugar for sweetness.
                        Don’t skip out
                        on the bay leaves, they make a huge difference.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Dried whole cloves! My mom learned this trick from her friend Virginia, and adding a few whole
                        cloves was
                        the secret ingredient I’d been missing lo these many years. My mom uses 5-6 cloves but my
                        husband prefers
                        four. The cloves give it an earthy, spiced flavor that’s not often easy to place. It’s a total
                        surprise when
                        I tell people they’re in there, or if they discover one on their own hidden in their
                        spaghetti-sauced bite
                        if I forget or can’t find them to fish them out before serving.</p>
