                        Nigerian Jollof Rice or Jellof rice is a rich and incredibly tasty west African one-pot Meal. It
                        is a very versatile dish, and it is usually made from scratch using Rice, Tomatoes, Pimento
                        peppers, Tomato paste, Scotch bonnet, Onions, Salt, and other spices.

                    <p> <strong>Jollof Rice Recipe</strong>
                        
                        Jollof rice is one of the most common West African dishes eaten in the regions of Nigeria,
                        Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Cameroun, and Liberia. However,
                        each of these West African countries has their own variation of this meal. It is inexpensive and
                        easy to make yet, delicious.

                    <p>
                        <strong> How To Cook Jollof Rice</strong>
                        
                        When cooking Jellof rice, building a flavor base is very important. Don’t be in haste to dump
                        your ingredients in the pot otherwise, you will end up with what we call ”concoction”. Each step
                        counts so try to do each of the steps in detail.
                    </p>
                    

                    <p> The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the
                        Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the Tomato paste.
                        This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabouts.
                        Add the Ginger and Garlic and cook along with the Tomato paste for another two minutes;
                        Actually, by the time this ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any
                        longer you might risk burning them.</p>
                    
                    <p> Add my blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I
                        often stop when the sauce becomes really thick and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce.
                        At this point, most of the water is gone and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me you will
                        know but just in case, you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 20 to 25 minutes depending on
                        the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally, in building my flavor, I add the Thyme, Curry powder, Salt, white pepper (good but
                        optional) and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to. Once
                        the flavor is on point, then, I stir in my Rice. Make sure you stir the Rice properly until you
                        cover each grain of Rice with the sauce. Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and
                        cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice
                        with a foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam
                        in order to turn out well.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Once, the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook
                        until the rice is done about 20 to 25 minutes.
                        Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish or Gizzards and plantains.
