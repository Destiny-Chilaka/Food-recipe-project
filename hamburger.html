                    <p >You can search the web and find all sorts of burger recipes, but when it
                        comes to making a classic, no-frills, juicy hamburger, all you need is good quality meat, and a
                        good burger seasoning. There’s no need for fillers like eggs or breadcrumbs. I’ll walk you
                        through the simple steps to how to prepare, season, and cook the burgers, plus make-ahead and
                        freezing instructions.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                           <strong> What type of meat is best?:</strong>
                            
                            The quality and fat content in the meat used in your burger will make all of the difference!
                            When choosing the best kind of meat for hamburgers, choose ground chuck over ground beef. Ground
                            chuck is the best type of meat for hamburgers and it’s different from ground beef as it comes
                            from the beef shoulders, where ground beef is leftover pieces of beef from many different cuts.
                            For an extra delicious burger try a combination of 60% ground chuck and 40% brisket.</p>
                            

                       <p>   You could use ground beef, but for best results and flavor be sure the meat is at least 20% fat
                        (not lean). A 90/10 mix can result in a dry hamburger, but if it’s all you have on hand you
                        could add chopped bacon, or a tablespoon of olive oil.
                        </p>
                        

                      <p> <strong> Burger Seasoning:</strong>
                        
                        Hopefully your pantry is already stocked with the spices you need to make this simple burger
                        seasoning!

                        1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper,
                        1 teaspoon salt,
                        2 teaspoons paprika,
                        ½ teaspoon brown sugar,
                        ¼ teaspoon garlic powder,
                        ¼ teaspoon onion powder,
                        ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper,
                        Mix all spices together and if not using immediately, store in an airtight container in a dark
                        cool place for several months.</p>
                        
                        


                     <p>  <strong> Toppings:</strong>
                        Cheese: cheddar cheese, or your favorite kind.
                        Lettuce leaves.
                        Tomato: beefsteak tomatoes are preferred, but any will work.
                        Onion: Red or white onion, thinly sliced.
                        Pickle slices.
                        Condiments: ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, Thousand island dressing, Ranch dressing, homemade
                        Chick-fil A Sauce.</p>
                        

                      <p> <strong> How to Make a Perfect Hamburger:</strong>
                        
                         1. Prep seasoning. Combine all spices in a bowl. Set aside.
                         
 
                         2. Form patties. Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently form into ½ inch thick
                         patties that are wider than the burger buns (as they will shrink). Use your thumb to press an
                         indentation into the center of each patty. Cover and set aside.
                         
 
                         3. Grill. Just before cooking, sprinkle seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill,
                         indent-side up. Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is
                         seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes
                         or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F. If adding cheese, place cheese slices on burgers during
                         the last minute of cooking.
                         
 
 
                         4. Serve. Remove patties to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving in a bun,
                         with toppings.</p>
