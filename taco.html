                        Tips from the Betty Crocker Kitchens
                    </p>
                    

                    <p> <strong> Tip 1:</strong>
                        Create a small condiment bar to serve alongside your easy ground beef tacos: in addition to the
                        lettuce, tomato and cheese, set out small bowls of chopped avocado, sliced radishes, sweet bell
                        pepper, additional salsa and fresh cilantro.</p>
                    

                    <p><strong> Tip 2:</strong>
                        Turn these Easy Beef Tacos into taco bowls by spooning the salsa-seasoned beef onto a bed of
                        shredded lettuce, topped with the tomatoes and cheese. Sprinkle with crushed tortilla chips for
                        added crunch.</p>
                    

                    <p><strong> Tip 3:</strong>
                        Look for shredded Mexican cheese blends where you’d find the Cheddar cheese—they’re a mix of
                        Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Colby, and sometimes a sprinkle of mild chili powder.</p>
                    

                    <strong>Tip 4:</strong>
                    Try switching up this simple ground beef taco recipe by using ground chicken or ground turkey
                    instead.</p>
